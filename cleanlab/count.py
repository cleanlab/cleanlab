Methods to estimate latent structures used for confident learning, including:

* Latent prior of the unobserved, error-less labels: `py`: ``p(y)``
* Latent noisy channel (noise matrix) characterizing the flipping rates: `nm`: ``P(given label | true label)``
* Latent inverse noise matrix characterizing the flipping process: `inv`: ``P(true label | given label)``
* Latent `confident_joint`, an un-normalized matrix that counts the confident subset of label errors under the joint distribution for true/given label

These are estimated from a classification dataset. This module considers two types of datasets:

* standard (multi-class) classification where each example is labeled as belonging to exactly one of K classes (e.g. ``labels = np.array([0,0,1,0,2,1])``)
* multi-label classification where each example can be labeled as belonging to multiple classes (e.g. ``labels = [[1,2],[1],[0],[],...]``)

    """Estimates the number of label issues in a classification dataset. Use this method to get the most accurate
    estimate of number of label issues when you don't need the indices of the examples with label issues.

    Parameters
    ----------
    labels : np.ndarray or list
      Given class labels for each example in the dataset, some of which may be erroneous,
      in same format expected by :py:func:`filter.find_label_issues <cleanlab.filter.find_label_issues>` function.

    pred_probs :
      Model-predicted class probabilities for each example in the dataset,
      in same format expected by :py:func:`filter.find_label_issues <cleanlab.filter.find_label_issues>` function.

    confident_joint :
      Array of estimated class label error statisics used for identifying label issues,
      in same format expected by :py:func:`filter.find_label_issues <cleanlab.filter.find_label_issues>` function.
      The `confident_joint` can be computed using `~cleanlab.count.compute_confident_joint`.
      It is internally computed from the given (noisy) `labels` and `pred_probs`.

    estimation_method :
      Method for estimating the number of label issues in dataset by counting the examples in the off-diagonal of the `confident_joint` ``P(label=i, true_label=j)``.

      * ``'off_diagonal'``: Counts the number of examples in the off-diagonal of the `confident_joint`. Returns the same value as ``sum(find_label_issues(filter_by='confident_learning'))``

      * ``'off_diagonal_calibrated'``: Calibrates confident joint estimate ``P(label=i, true_label=j)`` such that
        ``np.sum(cj) == len(labels)`` and ``np.sum(cj, axis = 1) == np.bincount(labels)`` before counting the number
        of examples in the off-diagonal. Number will always be equal to or greater than
        ``estimate_issues='off_diagonal'``. You can use this value as the cutoff threshold used with ranking/scoring
        functions from :py:mod:`cleanlab.rank` with `num_label_issues` over ``estimation_method='off_diagonal'`` in
        two cases:

        #. As we add more label and data quality scoring functions in :py:mod:`cleanlab.rank`, this approach will always work.
        #. If you have a custom score to rank your data by label quality and you just need to know the cut-off of likely label issues.

      * ``'off_diagonal_custom'``: Counts the number of examples in the off-diagonal of a provided `confident_joint` matrix.

      TL;DR: Use this method to get the most accurate estimate of number of label issues when you don't need the indices of the label issues.

      Note: ``'off_diagonal'`` may sometimes underestimate issues for data with few classes, so consider using ``'off_diagonal_calibrated'`` instead if your data has < 4 classes.

    multi_label : bool, optional
      Set ``False`` if your dataset is for regular (multi-class) classification, where each example belongs to exactly one class.
      Set ``True`` if your dataset is for multi-label classification, where each example can belong to multiple classes.
      See documentation of `~cleanlab.count.compute_confident_joint` for details.

      See documentation of `~cleanlab.count.compute_confident_joint` for details.
      In multi-label classification, the confident/calibrated joint arrays have shape ``(K, 2, 2)``

      3.1, Equation 2).

      This is for advanced users only. If not specified, these are computed
      for you automatically. If an example has a predicted probability
      greater than this threshold, it is counted as having true_label =
      k. This is not used for pruning/filtering, only for estimating the
      noise rates using confident counts.

    calibrate : bool, default=True
        Calibrates confident joint estimate ``P(label=i, true_label=j)`` such that
        ``np.sum(cj) == len(labels)`` and ``np.sum(cj, axis = 1) == np.bincount(labels)``.
        When ``calibrate=True``, this method returns an estimate of
        the latent true joint counts of noisy and true labels.

    multi_label : bool, optional
      If ``True``, this is multi-label classification dataset (where each example can belong to more than one class)
      rather than a regular (multi-class) classifiction dataset.
      In this case, `labels` should be an iterable (e.g. list) of iterables (e.g. ``List[List[int]]``),
      containing the list of classes to which each example belongs, instead of just a single class.
      Example of `labels` for a multi-label classification dataset: ``[[0,1], [1], [0,2], [0,1,2], [0], [1], [], ...]``.

    return_indices_of_off_diagonals : bool, optional
      If ``True``, returns indices of examples that were counted in off-diagonals
      of confident joint as a baseline proxy for the label issues. This
      sometimes works as well as ``filter.find_label_issues(confident_joint)``.


    Returns
    -------
    confident_joint_counts : np.ndarray
      An array of shape ``(K, K)`` representing counts of examples
      for which we are confident about their given and true label (if `multi_label` is False).
      If `multi_label` is True,
      this array instead has shape ``(K, 2, 2)`` representing a one-vs-rest format for the  confident joint, where for each class `c`:
      Entry ``(c, 0, 0)`` in this one-vs-rest array is the number of examples whose noisy label contains `c` confidently identified as truly belonging to class `c` as well.
      Entry ``(c, 1, 0)`` in this one-vs-rest array is the number of examples whose noisy label contains `c` confidently identified as not actually belonging to class `c`.
      Entry ``(c, 0, 1)`` in this one-vs-rest array is the number of examples whose noisy label does not contain `c` confidently identified as truly belonging to class `c`.
      Entry ``(c, 1, 1)`` in this one-vs-rest array is the number of examples whose noisy label does not contain `c` confidently identified as actually not belonging to class `c` as well.


      Note
      ----
      If `return_indices_of_off_diagonals` is set as True, this function instead returns a tuple `(confident_joint, indices_off_diagonal)`
      where `indices_off_diagonal` is a list of arrays and each array contains the indices of examples counted in off-diagonals of confident joint.

    Note
    ----
    We provide a for-loop based simplification of the confident joint
    below. This implementation is not efficient, not used in practice, and
    not complete, but covers the gist of how the confident joint is computed:

    .. code:: python

        # Confident examples are those that we are confident have true_label = k
        # Estimate (K, K) matrix of confident examples with label = k_s and true_label = k_y
        cj_ish = np.zeros((K, K))
        for k_s in range(K): # k_s is the class value k of noisy labels `s`
            for k_y in range(K): # k_y is the (guessed) class k of true_label k_y
                cj_ish[k_s][k_y] = sum((pred_probs[:,k_y] >= (thresholds[k_y] - 1e-8)) & (labels == k_s))

    The following is a vectorized (but non-parallelized) implementation of the
    confident joint, again slow, using for-loops/simplified for understanding.
    This implementation is 100% accurate, it's just not optimized for speed.

        confident_joint = np.zeros((K, K), dtype = int)

    See `compute_confident_joint` docstring for more info.

    Parameters
    ----------
    labels : list of list/iterable (length N)
        Given noisy labels for multi-label classification.
        Must be a list of lists (or a list of np.ndarrays or iterable).
        The i-th element is a list containing the classes that the i-th example belongs to.

    pred_probs : np.ndarray (shape (N, K))
        P(label=k|x) is a matrix with K model-predicted probabilities.
        Each row of this matrix corresponds to an example `x` and contains the model-predicted
        probabilities that `x` belongs to each possible class.
        The columns must be ordered such that these probabilities correspond to class 0, 1, 2,..., K-1.
        `pred_probs` must be out-of-sample (ideally should have been computed using 3+ fold cross-validation).

    thresholds : iterable (list or np.ndarray) of shape (K, 1)  or (K,)
        P(label^=k|label=k). If an example has a predicted probability "greater" than
        this threshold, it is counted as having true_label = k. This is
        not used for filtering/pruning, only for estimating the noise rates using
        confident counts. This value should be between 0 and 1. Default is None.

    calibrate : bool, default = True
        Calibrates confident joint estimate P(label=i, true_label=j) such that
        ``np.sum(cj) == len(labels) and np.sum(cj, axis = 1) == np.bincount(labels)``.

    return_indices_of_off_diagonals: bool, default = False
        If true returns indices of examples that were counted in off-diagonals
        of confident joint as a baseline proxy for the label issues. This
        sometimes works as well as filter.find_label_issues(confident_joint).

    Returns
    -------
    confident_joint_counts : np.ndarray
      An array of shape ``(K, 2, 2)`` representing the confident joint of noisy and true labels for each class, in a one-vs-rest format employed for multi-label settings.

    Note: if `return_indices_of_off_diagonals` is set as True, this function instead returns a tuple `(confident_joint_counts, indices_off_diagonal)`

    Notes: There are two ways to compute the confident joint with pros/cons.
    (1) For each holdout set, we compute the confident joint, then sum them up.
    (2) Compute pred_proba for each fold, combine, compute the confident joint.
    (1) is more accurate because it correctly computes thresholds for each fold
    (2) is more accurate when you have only a little data because it computes
    the confident joint using all the probabilities. For example if you had 100
    examples, with 5-fold cross validation + uniform p(y) you would only have 20
    examples to compute each confident joint for (1). Such small amounts of data
    is bound to result in estimation errors. For this reason, we implement (2),
    but we implement (1) as a commented out function at the end of this file.

    Parameters
    ----------
    X : np.ndarray or pd.DataFrame
      Input feature matrix of shape ``(N, ...)``, where N is the number of

      A 1D array of shape ``(N,)`` containing class labels for a standard (multi-class) classification dataset.
      Some given labels may be erroneous.
      Elements must be integers in the set 0, 1, ..., K-1, where K is the number of classes.
      All classes must be present in the dataset.

    clf : estimator instance, optional
      A classifier implementing the `sklearn estimator API
      <https://scikit-learn.org/stable/developers/develop.html#rolling-your-own-estimator>`_.

    cv_n_folds : int, default=5
      The number of cross-validation folds used to compute
      out-of-sample predicted probabilities for each example in `X`.

    thresholds : array_like, optional
      An array of shape ``(K, 1)`` or ``(K,)`` of per-class threshold

      This is for advanced users only. If not specified, these are computed

    This function estimates the `noise_matrix` of shape ``(K, K)``. This is the

    `noise_matrix` is a conditional probability matrix for ``P(label=k_s|true_label=k_y)``.

    Under certain conditions, estimates are exact, and in most
    conditions, estimates are within one percent of the actual noise rates.

    Parameters
    ----------
    X : np.ndarray
      Input feature matrix of shape ``(N, ...)``, where N is the number of
      examples. The classifier that this instance was initialized with,
      `clf`, must be able to handle data with this shape.

      A 1D array of shape ``(N,)`` containing class labels for a standard (multi-class) classification dataset.
      Some given labels may be erroneous.
      Elements must be integers in the set 0, 1, ..., K-1, where K is the number of classes.
      All classes must be present in the dataset.

    clf : estimator instance, optional
      A classifier implementing the `sklearn estimator API
      <https://scikit-learn.org/stable/developers/develop.html#rolling-your-own-estimator>`_.

    cv_n_folds : int, default=5
      The number of cross-validation folds used to compute
      out-of-sample probabilities for each example in `X`.

    thresholds : array_like, optional
      An array of shape ``(K, 1)`` or ``(K,)`` of per-class threshold
      probabilities, used to determine the cutoff probability necessary to
      consider an example as a given class label (see `Northcutt et al.,
      2021 <https://jair.org/index.php/jair/article/view/12125>`_, Section

      This is for advanced users only. If not specified, these are computed

      greater than this threshold, it is counted as having true_label =
      k. This is not used for pruning/filtering, only for estimating the
      noise rates using confident counts.

    converge_latent_estimates : bool, optional
      If ``True``, forces numerical consistency of estimates. Each is estimated
      independently, but they are related mathematically with closed form
      equivalences. This will iteratively make them mathematically consistent.

    py_method : {"cnt", "eqn", "marginal", "marginal_ps"}, default="cnt"
      How to compute the latent prior ``p(true_label=k)``. Default is ``"cnt"`` as it often
      works well even when the noise matrices are estimated poorly by using
      the matrix diagonals instead of all the probabilities.

    seed : int, optional
      Set the default state of the random number generator used to split
      the cross-validated folds. If ``None``, uses ``np.random`` current random state.

    clf_kwargs : dict, optional
      Optional keyword arguments to pass into `clf`'s ``fit()`` method.

    py := P(true_label=k) and the inverse noise matrix P(true_label=k_y|label=k_s) specify one

    Note that we have to first converge the inverse_noise_matrix and py,

    The confident class threshold for a class j is the expected (average) "self-confidence" for class j in a one-vs-rest setting.

    Parameters
    ----------
    labels: list
       Refer to documentation for this argument in ``count.calibrate_confident_joint()`` with ``multi_label=True`` for details.

    pred_probs : np.ndarray
       Predicted class probabilities in the same format expected by the `~cleanlab.count.get_confident_thresholds` function.

    Returns
    -------
    confident_thresholds : np.ndarray
      An array of shape ``(K, 2, 2)`` where `K` is the number of classes, in a one-vs-rest format.
