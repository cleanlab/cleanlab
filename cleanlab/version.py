#   - Re-invented better algorithms and published paper describing how the new algorithms work and benchmarking their effectiveness.
#   - Provided new quickstart tutorials and examples on how to use cleanlab for multi-label datasets and train effective models for them.
#
#   Additional improvements:
#   - cleanlab now works much better for datasets in which some classes happen to not be present.
#   - Algorithmic improvements to ensure count.num_label_issues() returns more accurate estimates.
#   - For developers: introduction of flake8 code linter and more comprehensive mypy type annotations.

# 2.1.0 - "Multiannotator, Outlier detection, and Token Classification" - Cleanlab supports several new features
#
#   For users (+ sometimes developers):
