class OutOfDistribution:
    """
    Provides scores to detect Out Of Distribution (OOD) examples that are outliers in a dataset.

    Each example's OOD score lies in [0,1] with smaller values indicating examples that are less typical under the data distribution.
    OOD scores may be estimated from either: numeric feature embeddings or predicted probabilities from a trained classifier.

    To get indices of examples that are the most severe outliers, call `~cleanlab.rank.find_top_issues` function on the returned OOD scores.

    Parameters
    ----------
    params : dict, default = {}
     Optional keyword arguments to control how this estimator is fit. Effect of arguments passed in depends on if
     `OutOfDistribution` estimator will rely on `features` or `pred_probs`. These are stored as an instance attribute `self.params`.

     If `features` is passed in during ``fit()``, `params` could contain following keys:
       *  knn: sklearn.neighbors.NearestNeighbors, default = None
             Instantiated ``NearestNeighbors`` object that's been fitted on a dataset in the same feature space.
             Note that the distance metric and `n_neighbors` is specified when instantiating this class.
             You can also pass in a subclass of ``sklearn.neighbors.NearestNeighbors`` which allows you to use faster
             approximate neighbor libraries as long as you wrap them behind the same sklearn API.
             If you specify ``knn`` here, there is no need to later call ``fit()`` before calling ``score()``.
             If ``knn is None``, then by default:
             The knn object is instantiated as ``sklearn.neighbors.NearestNeighbors(n_neighbors=k, metric=dist_metric).fit(features)``.
             - If ``dim(features) > 3``, the distance metric is set to "cosine".
             - If ``dim(features) <= 3``, the distance metric is set to "euclidean".
               The implementation of the euclidean distance metric depends on the number of examples in the features array:
                - For more than 100 rows, it uses scikit-learn's "euclidean" metric. This is for efficiency reasons reasons.
                - For 100 or fewer rows, it uses scipy's ``scipy.spatial.distance.euclidean`` metric. This is for numerical stability reasons.
             See: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/neighbors.html
             See: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.pairwise.euclidean_distances.html
             See: https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.spatial.distance.euclidean.html
       *  k : int, default=None
             Optional number of neighbors to use when calculating outlier score (average distance to neighbors).
             If `k` is not provided, then by default ``k = knn.n_neighbors`` or ``k = 10`` if ``knn is None``.
             If an existing ``knn`` object is provided, you can still specify that outlier scores should use
             a different value of `k` than originally used in the ``knn``,
             as long as your specified value of `k` is smaller than the value originally used in ``knn``.
       *  t : int, default=1
             Optional hyperparameter only for advanced users.
             Controls transformation of distances between examples into similarity scores that lie in [0,1].
             The transformation applied to distances `x` is ``exp(-x*t)``.
             If you find your scores are all too close to 1, consider increasing `t`,
             although the relative scores of examples will still have the same ranking across the dataset.

     If `pred_probs` is passed in during ``fit()``, `params` could contain following keys:
       *  confident_thresholds: np.ndarray, default = None
             An array of shape ``(K, )`` where K is the number of classes.
             Confident threshold for a class j is the expected (average) "self-confidence" for that class.
             If you specify `confident_thresholds` here, there is no need to later call ``fit()`` before calling ``score()``.
       *  adjust_pred_probs : bool, True
             If True, account for class imbalance by adjusting predicted probabilities
             via subtraction of class confident thresholds and renormalization.
             If False, you do not have to pass in `labels` later to fit this OOD estimator.
             See `Northcutt et al., 2021 <https://jair.org/index.php/jair/article/view/12125>`_.
       *  method : {"entropy", "least_confidence"}, default="entropy"
             Method to use when computing outlier scores based on `pred_probs`.
             Letting length-K vector ``P = pred_probs[i]`` denote the given predicted class-probabilities
             for the i-th example in dataset, its outlier score can either be:

             - ``'entropy'``: ``1 - sum_{j} P[j] * log(P[j]) / log(K)``
             - ``'least_confidence'``: ``max(P)`` (equivalent to Maximum Softmax Probability method from the OOD detection literature)
             - ``gen``: Generalized ENtropy score from the paper of Liu, Lochman, and Zach (https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/papers/Liu_GEN_Pushing_the_Limits_of_Softmax-Based_Out-of-Distribution_Detection_CVPR_2023_paper.pdf)

        pred_probs : np.ndarray, optional
           An array of shape ``(N, K)`` of model-predicted probabilities,

          *Format requirements*: for dataset with K classes, labels must be in 0, 1, ..., K-1.

        Score for each example corresponds to the likelihood this example stems from the same distribution as the dataset previously specified in ``fit()`` (i.e. is not an outlier).
