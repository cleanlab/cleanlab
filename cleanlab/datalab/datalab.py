class Datalab:
    """
    A single object to automatically detect all kinds of issues in datasets.
    This is how we recommend you interface with the cleanlab library if you want to audit the quality of your data and detect issues within it.
    If you have other specific goals (or are doing a less standard ML task not supported by Datalab), then consider using the other methods across the library.
    Datalab tracks intermediate state (e.g. data statistics) from certain cleanlab functions that can be re-used across other cleanlab functions for better efficiency.

    Parameters
    ----------
    data : Union[Dataset, pd.DataFrame, dict, list, str]
        Dataset-like object that can be converted to a Hugging Face Dataset object.

        It should contain the labels for all examples, identified by a
        `label_name` column in the Dataset object.

        Supported formats:
          - datasets.Dataset
          - pandas.DataFrame
          - dict (keys are strings, values are arrays/lists of length ``N``)
          - list (list of dictionaries that each have the same keys)
          - str

            - path to a local file: Text (.txt), CSV (.csv), JSON (.json)
            - or a dataset identifier on the Hugging Face Hub

    task : str
        The type of machine learning task that the dataset is used for.

        Supported tasks:
          - "classification" (default): Multiclass classification
          - "regression" : Regression
          - "multilabel" : Multilabel classification

    label_name : str, optional
        The name of the label column in the dataset.

    image_key : str, optional
        Optional key that can be specified for image datasets to point to the field (column) containing the actual images themselves (as PIL objects).
        If specified, additional image-specific issue types will be checked for in the dataset.
        See the `CleanVision package <https://github.com/cleanlab/cleanvision?tab=readme-ov-file#clean-your-data-for-better-computer-vision>`_ for descriptions of these image-specific issue types.
        Currently, this argument is only supported for data formatted as a Hugging Face ``datasets.Dataset`` object.


    verbosity : int, optional
        The higher the verbosity level, the more information
        Datalab prints when auditing a dataset.
        Valid values are 0 through 4. Default is 1.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import datasets
    >>> from cleanlab import Datalab
    >>> data = datasets.load_dataset("glue", "sst2", split="train")
    >>> datalab = Datalab(data, label_name="label")

        Checks the dataset for all sorts of common issues in real-world data (in both labels and feature values).

        You can use Datalab to find issues in your data, utilizing *any* model you have already trained.
        This method only interacts with your model via its predictions or embeddings (and other functions thereof).
        The more of these inputs you provide, the more types of issues Datalab can detect in your dataset/labels.
        If you provide a subset of these inputs, Datalab will output what insights it can based on the limited information from your model.

        NOTE
        ----
        The issues are saved in the ``self.issues`` attribute of the ``Datalab`` object, but are not returned.

        Parameters
        ----------
        pred_probs :
            Out-of-sample predicted class probabilities made by the model for every example in the dataset.
            To best detect label issues, provide this input obtained from the most accurate model you can produce.

            For classification data, this must be a 2D array with shape ``(num_examples, K)`` where ``K`` is the number of classes in the dataset.
            Make sure that the columns of your `pred_probs` are properly ordered with respect to the ordering of classes, which for Datalab is: lexicographically sorted by class name.

            For regression data, this must be a 1D array with shape ``(num_examples,)`` containing the predicted value for each example.

            For multilabel classification data, this must be a 2D array with shape ``(num_examples, K)`` where ``K`` is the number of classes in the dataset.
                Make sure that the columns of your `pred_probs` are properly ordered with respect to the ordering of classes, which for Datalab is: lexicographically sorted by class name.


        features : Optional[np.ndarray]
            Feature embeddings (vector representations) of every example in the dataset.

            If provided, this must be a 2D array with shape (num_examples, num_features).

        knn_graph :
            Sparse matrix of precomputed distances between examples in the dataset in a k nearest neighbor graph.

            If provided, this must be a square CSR matrix with shape ``(num_examples, num_examples)`` and ``(k*num_examples)`` non-zero entries (``k`` is the number of nearest neighbors considered for each example),
            evenly distributed across the rows.
            Each non-zero entry in this matrix is a distance between a pair of examples in the dataset. Self-distances must be omitted
            (i.e. diagonal must be all zeros, k nearest neighbors for each example do not include the example itself).

            This CSR format uses three 1D arrays (`data`, `indices`, `indptr`) to store a 2D matrix ``M``:

            - `data`: 1D array containing all the non-zero elements of matrix ``M``, listed in a row-wise fashion (but sorted within each row).
            - `indices`: 1D array storing the column indices in matrix ``M`` of these non-zero elements. Each entry in `indices` corresponds to an entry in `data`, indicating the column of ``M`` containing this entry.
            - `indptr`: 1D array indicating the start and end indices in `data` for each row of matrix ``M``. The non-zero elements of the i-th row of ``M`` are stored from ``data[indptr[i]]`` to ``data[indptr[i+1]]``.

            Within each row of matrix ``M`` (defined by the ranges in `indptr`), the corresponding non-zero entries (distances) of `knn_graph` must be sorted in ascending order (specifically in the segments of the `data` array that correspond to each row of ``M``). The `indices` array must also reflect this ordering, maintaining the correct column positions for these sorted distances.

            This type of matrix is returned by the method: `sklearn.neighbors.NearestNeighbors.kneighbors_graph <https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.neighbors.NearestNeighbors.html#sklearn.neighbors.NearestNeighbors.kneighbors_graph>`_.

            Below is an example to illustrate:

            .. code-block:: python

                knn_graph.todense()
                # matrix([[0. , 0.3, 0.2],
                #         [0.3, 0. , 0.4],
                #         [0.2, 0.4, 0. ]])

                knn_graph.data
                # array([0.2, 0.3, 0.3, 0.4, 0.2, 0.4])
                # Here, 0.2 and 0.3 are the sorted distances in the first row, 0.3 and 0.4 in the second row, and so on.

                knn_graph.indices
                # array([2, 1, 0, 2, 0, 1])
                # Corresponding neighbor indices for the distances from the `data` array.

                knn_graph.indptr
                # array([0, 2, 4, 6])
                # The non-zero entries in the first row are stored from `knn_graph.data[0]` to `knn_graph.data[2]`, the second row from `knn_graph.data[2]` to `knn_graph.data[4]`, and so on.

            For any duplicated examples i,j whose distance is 0, there should be an *explicit* zero stored in the matrix, i.e. ``knn_graph[i,j] = 0``.

            If both `knn_graph` and `features` are provided, the `knn_graph` will take precendence.
            If `knn_graph` is not provided, it is constructed based on the provided `features`.
            If neither `knn_graph` nor `features` are provided, certain issue types like (near) duplicates will not be considered.

                `scipy.sparse.csr_matrix documentation <https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.sparse.csr_matrix.html>`_
                for more details on the CSR matrix format.

        issue_types :
            Collection specifying which types of issues to consider in audit and any non-default parameter settings to use.
            If unspecified, a default set of issue types and recommended parameter settings is considered.

            This is a dictionary of dictionaries, where the keys are the issue types of interest
            and the values are dictionaries of parameter values that control how each type of issue is detected (only for advanced users).
            More specifically, the values are constructor keyword arguments passed to the corresponding ``IssueManager``,
            which is responsible for detecting the particular issue type.

        Examples
        --------

        Here are some ways to provide inputs to :py:meth:`find_issues`:

        - Passing ``pred_probs``:
            .. code-block:: python

                >>> from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
                >>> import numpy as np
                >>> from cleanlab import Datalab
                >>> X = np.array([[0, 1], [1, 1], [2, 2], [2, 0]])
                >>> y = np.array([0, 1, 1, 0])
                >>> clf = LogisticRegression(random_state=0).fit(X, y)
                >>> pred_probs = clf.predict_proba(X)
                >>> lab = Datalab(data={"X": X, "y": y}, label_name="y")
                >>> lab.find_issues(pred_probs=pred_probs)


        - Passing ``features``:
            .. code-block:: python

                >>> from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
                >>> from sklearn.neighbors import NearestNeighbors
                >>> import numpy as np
                >>> from cleanlab import Datalab
                >>> X = np.array([[0, 1], [1, 1], [2, 2], [2, 0]])
                >>> y = np.array([0, 1, 1, 0])
                >>> lab = Datalab(data={"X": X, "y": y}, label_name="y")
                >>> lab.find_issues(features=X)

        .. note::

            You can pass both ``pred_probs`` and ``features`` to :py:meth:`find_issues` for a more comprehensive audit.

        - Passing a ``knn_graph``:
            .. code-block:: python

                >>> from sklearn.neighbors import NearestNeighbors
                >>> import numpy as np
                >>> from cleanlab import Datalab
                >>> X = np.array([[0, 1], [1, 1], [2, 2], [2, 0]])
                >>> y = np.array([0, 1, 1, 0])
                >>> nbrs = NearestNeighbors(n_neighbors=2, metric="euclidean").fit(X)
                >>> knn_graph = nbrs.kneighbors_graph(mode="distance")
                >>> knn_graph # Pass this to Datalab
                <4x4 sparse matrix of type '<class 'numpy.float64'>'
                        with 8 stored elements in Compressed Sparse Row format>
                >>> knn_graph.toarray()  # DO NOT PASS knn_graph.toarray() to Datalab, only pass the sparse matrix itself
                array([[0.        , 1.        , 2.23606798, 0.        ],
                        [1.        , 0.        , 1.41421356, 0.        ],
                        [0.        , 1.41421356, 0.        , 2.        ],
                        [0.        , 1.41421356, 2.        , 0.        ]])
                >>> lab = Datalab(data={"X": X, "y": y}, label_name="y")
                >>> lab.find_issues(knn_graph=knn_graph)

        - Configuring issue types:
            Suppose you want to only consider label issues. Just pass a dictionary with the key "label" and an empty dictionary as the value (to use default label issue parameters).

            .. code-block:: python

                >>> issue_types = {"label": {}}
                >>> # lab.find_issues(pred_probs=pred_probs, issue_types=issue_types)

            If you are advanced user who wants greater control, you can pass keyword arguments to the issue manager that handles the label issues.
            For example, if you want to pass the keyword argument "clean_learning_kwargs"
            to the constructor of the :py:class:`LabelIssueManager <cleanlab.datalab.internal.issue_manager.label.LabelIssueManager>`, you would pass:


            .. code-block:: python

                >>> issue_types = {
                ...     "label": {
                ...         "clean_learning_kwargs": {
                ...             "prune_method": "prune_by_noise_rate",
                ...         },
                ...     },
                ... }
                >>> # lab.find_issues(pred_probs=pred_probs, issue_types=issue_types)

        Each type of issue has a summary score, which is usually defined as an average of
        per-example issue-severity scores (over all examples in the dataset).
        So these summary scores are not directly tied to the number of examples estimated to exhibit
        a particular type of issue. Issue-severity (ie. quality of each example) is measured differently for each issue type,
        and these per-example scores are only comparable across different examples for the same issue-type, but are not comparable across different issue types.
        For instance, label quality might be scored via estimated likelihood of the given label,
        whereas outlier quality might be scored via distance to K-nearest-neighbors in feature space (fundamentally incomparable quantities).
        For some issue types, the summary score is not an average of per-example scores, but rather a global statistic of the dataset
        (eg. for `non_iid` issue type, the p-value for hypothesis test that data are IID).

        In summary, you can compare these summary scores across datasets for the same issue type, but never compare them across different issue types.

        Examples
        -------

        If checks for "label" and "outlier" issues were run,
        then the issue summary will look something like this:

        issue_type  score
        outlier     0.123
