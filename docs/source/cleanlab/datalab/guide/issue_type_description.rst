Datalab Issue Types
*******************


Types of issues Datalab can detect
===================================

This page describes the various types of issues that Datalab can detect in a dataset.
For each type of issue, we explain: what it says about your data if detected, why this matters, and what parameters you can optionally specify to control the detection of this issue.

In case you didn't know: you can alternatively use `Cleanlab Studio <https://cleanlab.ai/blog/data-centric-ai/>`_ to detect the same data issues as this package, plus `many more types of issues <https://help.cleanlab.ai/guide/concepts/cleanlab_columns/>`_, all without having to do any Machine Learning (or even write any code).

Estimates for Each Issue Type
------------------------------

Datalab produces three estimates for **each** type of issue (called say `<ISSUE_NAME>` here):


1. A numeric quality score `<ISSUE_NAME>_score` (between 0 and 1) estimating how severe this issue is exhibited in each example from a dataset. Examples with higher scores are less likely to suffer from this issue. Access these via: the :py:attr:`Datalab.issues <cleanlab.datalab.datalab.Datalab.issues>` attribute or the method :py:meth:`Datalab.get_issues(\<ISSUE_NAME\>) <cleanlab.datalab.datalab.Datalab.get_issues>`.
2. A Boolean `is_<ISSUE_NAME>_issue` flag for each example from a dataset. Examples where this has value  `True` are those estimated to exhibit this issue. Access these via: the :py:attr:`Datalab.issues <cleanlab.datalab.datalab.Datalab.issues>` attribute or the method :py:meth:`Datalab.get_issues(\<ISSUE_NAME\>) <cleanlab.datalab.datalab.Datalab.get_issues>`.
3. An overall dataset quality score (between 0 and 1), quantifying how severe this issue is overall across the entire dataset. Datasets with higher scores do not exhibit this issue as badly overall. Access these via: the :py:attr:`Datalab.issue_summary <cleanlab.datalab.datalab.Datalab.issue_summary>` attribute or the method :py:meth:`Datalab.get_issue_summary(\<ISSUE_NAME\>) <cleanlab.datalab.datalab.Datalab.get_issue_summary>`.

**Example (for the outlier issue type)**

.. code-block:: python

    issue_name = "outlier"  # how to reference the outlier issue type in code
    issue_score = "outlier_score"  # name of column with quality scores for the outlier issue type, atypical datapoints receive lower scores
    is_issue = "is_outlier_issue"  # name of Boolean column flagging which datapoints are considered outliers in the dataset

**Dataset vs. data point level issues**

Some issues are primarily about the overall dataset (e.g. non-IID, class imbalance, underperforming group), whereas others are primarily about individual examples (e.g. label issue, outlier, near duplicate, null, etc). The former issue types should be first investigated via the global score from :py:meth:`Datalab.get_issue_summary <cleanlab.datalab.datalab.Datalab.get_issue_summary>`, as the per-example results for such issues from :py:meth:`Datalab.get_issues <cleanlab.datalab.datalab.Datalab.get_issues>` require more expertise to interpret.

Inputs to Datalab
-----------------

Datalab estimates various issues based on the four inputs below.
Each input is optional, if you do not provide it, Datalab will skip checks for those types of issues that require this input.

1. ``label_name`` - a field in the dataset that the stores the annotated class for each example in a multi-class classification dataset.
2. ``pred_probs`` - predicted class probabilities output by your trained model for each example in the dataset (these should be out-of-sample, eg. produced via cross-validation).
3. ``features`` - numeric vector representations of the features for each example in the dataset. These may be embeddings from a (pre)trained model, or just a numerically-transformed version of the original data features.
4. ``knn_graph`` - K nearest neighbor graph represented as a sparse matrix of dissimilarity values between examples in the dataset. If both `knn_graph` and `features` are provided, the `knn_graph` takes precedence, and if only `features` is provided, then a `knn_graph` is internally constructed based on the (either euclidean or cosine) distance between different examplesâ€™ features.


Label Issue
-----------

Examples whose given label is estimated to be potentially incorrect (e.g. due to annotation error) are flagged as having label issues.
Datalab estimates which examples appear mislabeled as well as a numeric label quality score for each, which quantifies the likelihood that an example is correctly labeled.

For now, Datalab can only detect label issues in multi-class classification datasets, regression datasets, and multi-label classification datasets.
The cleanlab library has alternative methods you can use to detect label issues in other types of datasets (multi-annotator, token classification, etc.).

Label issues are calculated based on provided `pred_probs` from a trained model. If you do not provide this argument, but you do provide `features`, then a K Nearest Neighbor model will be fit to produce `pred_probs` based on your `features`. Otherwise if neither `pred_probs` nor `features` is provided, then this type of issue will not be considered.
For the most accurate results, provide out-of-sample `pred_probs` which can be obtained for a dataset via `cross-validation <https://docs.cleanlab.ai/stable/tutorials/pred_probs_cross_val.html>`_.

Having mislabeled examples in your dataset may hamper the performance of supervised learning models you train on this data.
For evaluating models or performing other types of data analytics, mislabeled examples may lead you to draw incorrect conclusions.
To handle mislabeled examples, you can either filter out the data with label issues or try to correct their labels.

Some metadata about label issues is stored in the `issues` attribute of the Datalab object.
Let's look at one way to access this information.

.. testcode::

    lab.get_issues("label").sort_values("label_score").head(5)

The output will look something like this:

.. testoutput::

``is_label_issue``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A boolean column that flags examples with label issues.
If `True`, the example is estimated to have a label issue.
If `False`, the example is estimated to not have a label issue.

``label_score``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A numeric column that gives the label quality score for each example.
The score lies between 0 and 1.
The lower the score, the less likely the given label is to be correct.


``given_label``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A column of the actual labels as provided in the original dataset.

``predicted_label``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A column of the predicted labels for each example. This column may contain different labels than the given label, especially when the example is estimated to have a label issue or when a model predicts a different label than the given label.

    {% endwith %}


Outlier Issue
-------------

Examples that are very different from the rest of the dataset (i.e. potentially out-of-distribution or rare/anomalous instances).

Outlier issues are calculated based on provided `features` , `knn_graph` , or `pred_probs`.
If you do not provide one of these arguments, this type of issue will not be considered.
This article describes how outlier issues are detected in a dataset: `https://cleanlab.ai/blog/outlier-detection/ <https://cleanlab.ai/blog/outlier-detection/>`_.

When based on `features` or `knn_graph`, the outlier quality of each example is scored inversely proportional to its distance to its K nearest neighbors in the dataset.

When based on `pred_probs`, the outlier quality of each example is scored inversely proportional to the uncertainty in its prediction.

Modeling data with outliers may have unexpected consequences.
Closely inspect them and consider removing some outliers that may be negatively affecting your models.


Learn more about the methods used to detect outliers in our article: `Out-of-Distribution Detection via Embeddings or Predictions <https://cleanlab.ai/blog/outlier-detection/>`_

Some metadata about outlier issues is stored in the `issues` attribute of the Datalab object.
Let's look at one way to access this information.

.. testcode::

    lab.get_issues("outlier").sort_values("outlier_score").head(5)

The output will look something like this:

.. testoutput::

        is_outlier_issue  outlier_score
    98              True       0.011562
    62             False       0.019657
    22             False       0.035243
    1              False       0.040907
    42             False       0.056865



``is_outlier_issue``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A boolean column, where `True` indicates that an example is identified as an outlier.

``outlier_score``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A numeric column with scores between 0 and 1.
A smaller value for an example indicates that it is less common or typical in the dataset, suggesting that it is more likely to be an outlier.

    {% with issue_name = "outlier" %}
    {% include "cleanlab/datalab/guide/_templates/issue_types_tip.rst" %}
    {% endwith %}

(Near) Duplicate Issue
----------------------

A (near) duplicate issue refers to two or more examples in a dataset that are extremely similar to each other, relative to the rest of the dataset.
The examples flagged with this issue may be exactly duplicated, or lie atypically close together when represented as vectors (i.e. feature embeddings).
Near duplicated examples may record the same information with different:

- Abbreviations, misspellings, typos, formatting, etc. in text data.
- Compression formats, resolutions, or sampling rates in image, video, and audio data.
- Minor variations which naturally occur in many types of data (e.g. translated versions of an image).

Near Duplicate issues are calculated based on provided `features` or `knn_graph`.
If you do not provide one of these arguments, this type of issue will not be considered.

Datalab defines near duplicates as those examples whose distance to their nearest neighbor (in the space of provided `features`) in the dataset is less than `c * D`, where `0 < c < 1` is a small constant, and `D` is the median (over the full dataset) of such distances between each example and its nearest neighbor.
Scoring the numeric quality of an example in terms of the near duplicate issue type is done proportionally to its distance to its nearest neighbor.

Including near-duplicate examples in a dataset may negatively impact a ML model's generalization performance and lead to overfitting.
In particular, it is questionable to include examples in a test dataset which are (nearly) duplicated in the corresponding training dataset.
More generally, examples which happen to be duplicated can affect theÂ final modeling results much more than other examples â€” so you should at least be aware of their presence.

Some metadata about near-duplicate issues is stored in the `issues` attribute of the Datalab object.
Let's look at one way to access this information.

.. testcode::

    lab.get_issues("near_duplicate").sort_values("near_duplicate_score").head(5)

The output will look something like this:

.. testoutput::

        is_near_duplicate_issue  near_duplicate_score near_duplicate_sets distance_to_nearest_neighbor
    36                     True              0.066009            [11, 80]                     0.003906

``is_near_duplicate_issue``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A boolean column, where `True` indicates that an example is identified as either a near- or exact-duplicate of other examples in the dataset.

``near_duplicate_score``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A numeric column with scores between 0 and 1. The lower the score, the more likely the example is to be a near-duplicate of another example in the dataset.

Exact duplicates are assigned a score of 0, while near-duplicates are assigned a score close to 0.

``near_duplicate_sets``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A column of lists of integers. The i-th list contains the indices of examples that are considered near-duplicates of example i (not including example i).

``distance_to_nearest_neighbor``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A numeric column that represents the distance between each example and its nearest neighbor in the dataset.
The distance is calculated based on the provided `features` or `knn_graph`, and is directly related to the `near_duplicate_score`.
A smaller distance indicates that the example is similar to another example in the dataset.

    {% endwith %}

Non-IID Issue
-------------

Whether the overall dataset exhibits statistically significant violations of the IID assumption like:  changepoints or shift, drift, autocorrelation, etc. The specific form of violation considered is whether the examples are ordered within the dataset such that almost adjacent examples tend to have more similar feature values. If you care about this check, do **not** first shuffle your dataset -- this check is entirely based on the sequential order of your data. Learn more via our blog: `https://cleanlab.ai/blog/non-iid-detection/ <https://cleanlab.ai/blog/non-iid-detection/>`_

The Non-IID issue is detected based on provided `features` or `knn_graph`. If you do not provide one of these arguments, this type of issue will not be considered. While the Non-IID check produces per-example information, it is primarily about assessing the overall dataset rather than assessing individual examples. So pay more attention to the overall dataset Non-IID score obtained via :py:meth:`Datalab.get_issue_summary("non_iid") <cleanlab.datalab.datalab.Datalab.get_issue_summary>` than the per-example scores.

The Non-IID issue is really a dataset-level check, not a per-datapoint level check (either a dataset violates the IID assumption or it doesn't). The per-datapoint scores returned for Non-IID issues merely highlight which datapoints you might focus on to better understand this dataset-level issue - there is not necessarily something specifically wrong with these specific datapoints.

Mathematically, the **overall** Non-IID score for the dataset is defined as the p-value of a statistical test for whether the distribution of *index-gap* values differs between group A vs. group B defined as follows. For a pair of examples in the dataset `x1, x2`, we define their *index-gap* as the distance between the indices of these examples in the ordering of the data (e.g. if `x1` is the 10th example and `x2` is the 100th example in the dataset, their index-gap is 90). We construct group A from pairs of examples which are amongst the K nearest neighbors of each other, where neighbors are defined based on the provided `knn_graph` or via distances in the space of the provided vector `features` . Group B is constructed from random pairs of examples in the dataset.

The Non-IID quality score for each example `x` is defined via a similarly computed p-value but with Group A constructed from the K nearest neighbors of `x` and Group B constructed from  random examples from the dataset paired with `x`. Learn more about this method in our paper: `Detecting Dataset Drift and Non-IID Sampling via k-Nearest Neighbors <https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15696>`_ (or the associated `blogpost <https://cleanlab.ai/blog/non-iid-detection/>`_).

The assumption that examples in a dataset are Independent and Identically Distributed (IID) is fundamental to proper modeling.  Detecting all possible violations of the IID assumption is statistically impossible. This issue type only considers specific forms of violation where examples that tend to be closer together in the dataset ordering also tend to have more similar feature values. This includes scenarios where:

- The underlying distribution from which examples stem is evolving/drifting over time (not identically distributed).
- An example can influence the values of future examples in the dataset (not independent).

For datasets with low non-IID score, you should consider why your data are not IID and act accordingly. For example, if the data distribution is drifting over time, consider employing a time-based train/test split instead of a random partition.  Note that shuffling the data ahead of time will ensure a good non-IID score, but this is not always a fix to the underlying problem (e.g. future deployment data may stem from a different distribution, or you may overlook the fact that examples influence each other). We thus recommend **not** shuffling your data to be able to diagnose this issue if it exists.

Some metadata about non-IID issues is stored in the `issues` attribute of the Datalab object.
Let's look at one way to access this information.

.. testcode::

    lab.get_issues("non_iid").sort_values("non_iid_score").head(5)

The output will look something like this:

.. testoutput::

        is_non_iid_issue  non_iid_score
    24             False       0.681458
    37             False       0.804582
    64             False       0.810646
    80             False       0.815691
    78             False       0.834293

``is_non_iid_issue``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A boolean column, where `True` values indicate that the dataset exhibits statistically significant violations of the IID assumption.
If the overall dataset does not appear to be Non-IID (p-value > 0.05), then all entries in this column will be `False`.
If the dataset appears to be Non-IID (p-value < 0.05), then one entry will be `True`, specifically the example with the lowest `non_iid_score`.
We do not recommend interpreting the per-example boolean values, as the Non-IID check is more about the overall dataset.

``non_iid_score``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A numeric column with scores between 0 and 1, containing the Non-IID quality scores for each example.
Learn more via our `blogpost <https://cleanlab.ai/blog/non-iid-detection/>`_.

Be cautious when interpreting the non-IID issue score for individual examples.
The dataset as a whole receives a p-value for our non-IID test (obtained via :py:meth:`Datalab.get_issue_summary("non_iid") <cleanlab.datalab.datalab.Datalab.get_issue_summary>`), which better indicates whether the dataset exhibits non-IID behavior.

When this p-value is low, you can use the per-example non-IID scores to identify which examples to look at for better understanding this non-IID behavior.

Class Imbalance Issue
---------------------

Class imbalance is diagnosed just using the `labels` provided as part of the dataset. The overall class imbalance quality score of a dataset is the proportion of examples belonging to the rarest class `q`. If this proportion `q` falls below a threshold, then we say this dataset suffers from the class imbalance issue.

In a dataset identified as having class imbalance, the class imbalance quality score for each example is set equal to `q` if it is labeled as the rarest class, and is equal to 1 for all other examples.

Class imbalance in a dataset can lead to subpar model performance for the under-represented class. Consider collecting more data from the under-represented class, or at least take special care while modeling via techniques like over/under-sampling, SMOTE, asymmetric class weighting, etc.

This issue-type is more about the overall dataset vs. individual data points. If severe class imbalance is detected, Datalab will flag the individual data points from the minority class.

Some metadata about class imbalance issues is stored in the `issues` attribute of the Datalab object.
Let's look at one way to access this information.

.. testcode::

    lab.get_issues("class_imbalance").sort_values("class_imbalance_score").head(5)

The output will look something like this:

.. testoutput::

        is_class_imbalance_issue  class_imbalance_score  given_label
    27                     False                   0.28            2
    72                     False                   0.28            2

    33                     False                   0.28            2
    68                     False                   0.28            2

``is_class_imbalance_issue``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A boolean column, where `True` indicates which examples belong to the minority class (rarest class) in a classification dataset that exhibits severe class imbalance.  If the dataset is not considered to have severe class imbalance (i.e. proportion of examples in the rarest class is not to small relative to the number of classes in the dataset), then all values will be `False`.


``class_imbalance_score``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A numeric column with scores between 0 and 1.
Any example belonging to the most under-represented class is assigned a score equal to the proportion of examples in the dataset belonging to that class.
All other examples are assigned a score of 1.
All examples sharing the same label also share the same score.

``given_label``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A column of the actual labels as provided in the original dataset.

Image-specific Issues
---------------------

Datalab can identify image-specific issues in datasets, such as images that are excessively dark or bright, blurry, lack detail, or have unusual sizes.
To detect these issues, simply specify the `image_key` argument in :py:meth:`~cleanlab.datalab.datalab.Datalab`, indicating the image column name in your dataset.
This functionality currently works only with Hugging Face datasets. You can convert other local dataset formats into a Hugging Face dataset by following `this guide <https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/en/loading>`_.
More information on these image-specific issues is available in the `CleanVision package <https://github.com/cleanlab/cleanvision?tab=readme-ov-file#clean-your-data-for-better-computer-vision>`_ .

Spurious Correlations between image-specific properties and labels
------------------------------------------------------------------

Based on the :ref:`image properties discussed earlier <Image-specific Issues>`, Datalab can also look for spurious correlations between image properties and the labels in the dataset.
These are unintended relationships between irrelevant features in images and the given labels, which ML models may easily exploit during training without learning the relevant features.
Once deployed, such models would consistently fail to generalize on unseen data where these spurious correlations most likely don't hold.

Spurious correlations may arise in the dataset due to various reasons, such as:

- Images for certain classes might be consistently captured under specific environmental conditions.
- Preprocessing techniques applied to the data might introduce systematic differences across classes.
- Objects of different classes may be systematically photographed in particular ways.

Spurious Correlations are checked for when Datalab is initialized for an image dataset with the `image_key` keyword argument,
after checking for :ref:`Image-specific Issues <Image-specific Issues>` where the image properties are computed.

Each image property (e.g. darkness/brightness) is assigned a label uncorrelatedness score for the entire dataset. The lower the score, the more strongly the property is correlated with the class labels, across images of the dataset. This score is mathematically defined as: 1 minus the relative accuracy improvement in predicting the labels based solely on this image property value (relative to always predicting the most common overall class).

Consider reviewing the relationship between images with high and low values of this property and the labels if the corresponding label uncorrelatedness score is low, because ML models trained on this dataset may latch onto the spurious correlation and fail to generalize.

This issue type is more about the overall dataset vs. individual data points and will only be highlighted by Datalab in its report, if any such troublesome image properties are found.

Metadata about spurious correlations is stored in the `info` attribute of the Datalab object.
It can be accessed like so:

.. code::

    lab.get_info("spurious_correlations")["correlations_df"]


The output will look something like this:

.. testoutput::

                         property         score

    Note that the label uncorrelatedness scores are *not* stored in the `issues` attribute of Datalab.

``property``
~~~~~~~~~~~~

A categorical column that identifies specific image-related characteristics assessed for potential spurious correlations with the class labels. Each entry in this column represents a distinct property of the images, such as blurriness, darkness, or grayscale, which may or may not be correlated with the labels.

``score``
~~~~~~~~~

A numeric column that gives the level of label uncorrelatedness for a given image-specific property. The score lies between 0 and 1. The lower the score for an image-property, the more correlated the image-property is with the given labels.

.. tip::

        This type of issue has the issue name `"spurious_correlations"`.

        Run a check for this particular kind of issue by calling :py:meth:`Datalab.find_issues() <cleanlab.datalab.datalab.Datalab.find_issues>` like so:

        .. code-block:: python

            # `lab` is a Datalab instance
            lab.find_issues(..., issue_types = {"spurious_correlations": {}})



Underperforming Group Issue
---------------------------

An underperforming group refers to a cluster of similar examples (i.e. a slice) in the dataset for which the ML model predictions are poor.  The examplesÂ in this underperforming group may have noisy labels or feature values, or the trained ML model may not have learned how to properly handle them (consider collecting more data from this subpopulation or up-weighting the existing dataÂ from this group).

This issue-type is more about the overall dataset vs. individual data points. If an underperforming group is detected, Datalab will flag the individual data points from this group.

Underperforming Group issues are detected based on one of:

- provided `pred_probs` and `features`,
- provided `pred_probs` and `knn_graph`, or
- provided `pred_probs` and `cluster_ids`. (This option is for advanced users, see the `FAQ <../../../tutorials/faq.html#How-do-I-specify-pre-computed-data-slices/clusters-when-detecting-the-Underperforming-Group-Issue?>`_ for more details.)

If you do not provide both these arguments, this type of issue will not be considered.

To find the underperforming group, Cleanlab clusters the data using the provided `features` and determines the cluster `c` with the lowest average model predictive performance. Model predictive performance is evaluated via the model's self-confidence of the given labels, calculated using :py:func:`rank.get_self_confidence_for_each_label <cleanlab.rank.get_self_confidence_for_each_label>`. Suppose the average predictive power across the full dataset is `r` and is `q` within a cluster of examples. This cluster is considered to be an underperforming group if `q/r` falls below a threshold. A dataset suffers from the Underperforming Group issue if there exists such a cluster within it.
The underperforming group quality score is equal to `q/r` for examples belonging to the underperforming group, and is equal to 1 for all other examples.
Advanced users:  If you have pre-computed cluster assignments for each example in the dataset, you can pass them explicitly to :py:meth:`Datalab.find_issues <cleanlab.datalab.datalab.Datalab.find_issues>` using the `cluster_ids` key in the `issue_types` dict argument.  This is useful for tabular datasets where you want to group/slice the data based on a categorical column. An integer encoding of the categorical column can be passed as cluster assignments for finding the underperforming group, based on the data slices you define.

Some metadata about underperforming group issues is stored in the `issues` attribute of the Datalab object.
Let's look at one way to access this information.

.. testcode::

    lab.get_issues("underperforming_group").sort_values("underperforming_group_score").head(5)

The output will look something like this:

.. testoutput::

        is_underperforming_group_issue  underperforming_group_score
    0                            False                          1.0
    72                           False                          1.0
    71                           False                          1.0
    70                           False                          1.0
    69                           False                          1.0

``is_underperforming_group_issue``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A boolean column, where `True` indicates which examples belong to the subgroup (i.e. cluster/slice) for which model predictions are significantly worse than for the rest of the dataset.
If there is no such underperforming subgroup detected, then all values will be `False`.

``underperforming_group_score``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A numeric column with scores between 0 and 1. Only examples belonging to a detected underperforming group receive a score less than 1.
Every example in the underperforming group shares the same score, which is the ratio of group's label quality score vs. the mean label quality score across the dataset.
The lower the score, the worse the model predictions are for this particular subgroup relative to the rest of the dataset.

.. jinja ::

    {% with issue_name = "underperforming_group" %}
    {% include "cleanlab/datalab/guide/_templates/issue_types_tip.rst" %}
    {% endwith %}

Null Issue
----------

Examples identified with the null issue correspond to rows that have null/missing values across all feature columns (i.e. the entire row is missing values).

Null issues are detected based on provided `features`.  If you do not provide `features`, this type of issue will not be considered.

Each example's null issue quality score equals the proportion of features values in this row that are not null/missing. The overall dataset null issue quality score
equals the average of the individual examples' quality scores.

Presence of null examples in the dataset can lead to errors when training ML models. It can also
result in the model learning incorrect patterns due to the null values.

Some metadata about null issues is stored in the `issues` attribute of the Datalab object.
Let's look at one way to access this information.

.. testcode::

    lab.get_issues("null").sort_values("null_score").head(5)

The output will look something like this:

.. testoutput::

        is_null_issue  null_score
    0           False         1.0
    72          False         1.0
    71          False         1.0
    70          False         1.0
    69          False         1.0

``is_null_issue``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A boolean column, where `True` indicates that an example is identified as having null/missing values across all feature columns.
Examples that just have a single non-null value across multiple feature columns are not flagged with this issue.

``null_score``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A numeric column with scores between 0 and 1. The score represents the proportion of non-null (i.e. non-missing) values in each example.
Lower scores indicate examples with more null/missing values.

.. jinja ::

    {% with issue_name = "null"%}
    {% include "cleanlab/datalab/guide/_templates/issue_types_tip.rst" %}
    {% endwith %}

Data Valuation Issue
--------------------

The examples in the dataset with lowest data valuation scores contribute least to a trained ML model's performance (those whose value falls below a threshold are flagged with this type of issue).

Data valuation issues can be detected based on provided `features` or a provided `knn_graph` (or one pre-computed during the computation of other issue types).  If you do not provide one of these two arguments and there isn't a `knn_graph` already stored in the Datalab object, this type of issue will not be considered.

The data valuation score is an approximate Data Shapley value, calculated based on the labels of the top k nearest neighbors of an example. The details of this KNN-Shapley value could be found in the papers: `Efficient Task-Specific Data Valuation for Nearest Neighbor Algorithms <https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.08619>`_ and `Scalability vs. Utility: Do We Have to Sacrifice One for the Other in Data Importance Quantification? <https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.07128>`_.

Some metadata about data valuation issues is stored in the `issues` attribute of the Datalab object.
Let's look at one way to access this information.

.. testcode::

    lab.get_issues("data_valuation").sort_values("data_valuation_score").head(5)

The output will look something like this:

.. testoutput::

        is_data_valuation_issue  data_valuation_score
    39                    False                   0.5
    32                    False                   0.5
    98                    False                   0.5
    6                     False                   0.5
    7                     False                   0.5

``is_data_valuation_issue``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A boolean column, where `True` indicates that an example does not appear to contribute positively to a model's training performance.

``data_valuation_score``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A numeric column with scores between 0 and 1. The score reflects how valuable each individual example is in terms of improving the performance of the ML model trained on this dataset.
Examples with higher scores more positively influence the resulting model's predictive performance, contributing to better learning. One would expect the model to get worse if many such examples were removed from its training dataset.
