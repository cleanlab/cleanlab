    "# Improving ML Performance via Data Curation with Train vs Test Splits\n",
    "\n",
    "In typical Machine Learning projects, we split our dataset into **training** data for fitting models and **test** data to evaluate model performance. For noisy real-world datasets, detecting/correcting errors in the training data is important to train robust models, but it's less recognized that the test set can also be noisy.\n",
    "For accurate model evaluation, it is vital to **find and fix issues in the test data** as well. Some evaluation metrics are particularly sensitive to outliers and noisy labels.\n",
    "This tutorial demonstrates a way to use cleanlab (via `Datalab`) to curate both your training and test data, ensuring **robust model training** and **reliable performance evaluation**.\n",
    "We recommend first completing some Datalab tutorials before diving into this more complex subject.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how we recommend handling noisy training and test data (this tutorial walks through these steps):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [Preprocess](https://towardsdatascience.com/introduction-to-data-preprocessing-in-machine-learning-a9fa83a5dc9d) your training and test data to be suitable for ML. Use cleanlab to check for fundamental train/test setup problems in the merged dataset like train/test leakage or drift.\n",
    "2. Fit your ML model to your noisy training data and get its predictions/embeddings for your test data. Use these model outputs with cleanlab to detect issues in your **test** data.\n",
    "3. Manually review/correct cleanlab-detected issues in your test data. **We caution against blindly automated correction of test data**. Changes to your test set should be carefully verified to ensure they will lead to more accurate model evaluation. We also caution against comparing the performance of different ML models across different versions of your test data; performance comparions between models should be based on the same test data.\n",
    "4. Cross-validate a new copy of your ML model on your training data, and then use it with cleanlab to detect issues in the **training** dataset. Do not include test data in any part of this step to avoid leaking test set information into the training data curation.\n",
    "5. You can try **automated techniques** to curate your training data based on cleanlab results, train models on the curated training data, and evaluate them on the cleaned test data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider this tutorial as a blueprint for using cleanlab in diverse ML projects spanning various data modalities. The same ideas apply if you substitute *test* data with *validation* data above. In a final advanced section of this tutorial, we show how training data edits can be parameterized in terms of cleanlab's detected issues, such that hyperparameter optimization can identify the optimal combination of data edits for training an effective ML model.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: This tutorial trains an XGBoost model on a tabular dataset, but the same approach applies to *any* ML model and data modality.\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification tasks where you already have high-quality test data and solely want to handle label errors in your training data, cleanlab's `CleanLearning` class offers an *alternative* convenience method to **train a robust ML model**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why did you make this tutorial?\n",
    "\n",
    "**TLDR:** Reliable ML requires both reliable training and reliable evaluation. This tutorial shows you how to achieve both using cleanlab.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Longer answer:** Many users wish to use cleanlab to improve their ML model by improving their data, but make subtle mistakes. This multi-step tutorial shows one way to do this properly.\n",
    "Some users curate (e.g. fix label issues in) their training data, train ML model, and evaluate it on test data. But they see no improvement in test-set accuracy, because they have introduced *distribution-shift* by altering their training data. If the test data also has issues, they must also be fixed for a faithful model evaluation.\n",
    "Other users therefore curate their test data too, but some blindly auto-fix their test data, which is dangerous! This cleanlab package is based on ML and thus inevitably imperfect. Issues that cleanlab detected in test data should **not** be blindly auto-fixed -- this risks making model evaluation wrong.\n",
    "Instead we recommend the multi-step workflow above, where less algorithmic/automated correction is applied to test data than to training data (focus your manual efforts on curating test rather than training data)."

    "Before training any ML model, we can quickly check for fundamental issues in our setup with cleanlab. To audit all of our data at once, we merge the training and test sets into one dataset, from which we construct a `Datalab` object. Datalab automatically detects many types of common issues in a dataset, but requires a trained ML model for a comprehensive audit. We haven't trained any model yet, so here we instruct Datalab to only check for specific data issues: near duplicates, and whether the data appears non-IID (violations of the IID assumption include: data drift or lack of statistical independence between data points).\n",

Below we provide `features = features_df` as the sole input to `Datalab.find_issues()`, which solely contains numerical values here. If you have heterogenoues/complex data types (eg. text or images), you could instead provide vector feature representations (eg. pretrained model embeddings) of your data as the `features`."

    "This tutorial demonstrated how you can properly use cleanlab to improve your own ML model. When dealing with noisy data, you should **first manually curate your test data to ensure reliable model evaluation**. After that, you can **algorithmically curate your training data**. We demonstrated a simple hyperparameter tuning technique to identify effective training data edits that produce an accurate model. As well as how cleanlab can help catch fundamental problems in the overall train/test setup like duplicates/leakage and data drift.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we never evaluated different models with different test set versions (which does **not** yield meaningful comparisons). We curated the test data to be as high-quality as possible and then based on model evaluations on this fixed version of the test data.\n",
    "\n",
    "For brevity, this tutorial focused mostly around label issues and data pruning strategies. You can achieve **better results** by considering additional data issues and curation strategies like fixing incorrect values -- this is all streamlined via the data correction interface in [Cleanlab Studio](https://cleanlab.ai/blog/data-centric-ai/)."
