    "In this 5-minute quickstart tutorial, we use cleanlab to find potential label errors in an intent classification dataset composed of (text) customer service requests at an online bank. We consider a subset of the [Banking77-OOS Dataset](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.04807.pdf) containing 1,000 customer service requests which can be classified into 10 categories corresponding to the intent of the request. Cleanlab automatically identifies bad examples in our dataset, including mislabeled data, out-of-scope examples (outliers), or otherwise ambiguous examples. Consider filtering or correcting such bad examples before you dive deep into modeling your data!\n",
