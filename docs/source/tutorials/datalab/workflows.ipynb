The strengths of this data structure lie in the assumption that data points are similar but not identical, allowing efficient similarity searches and proximity-based analyses.\n",
    "  - If you are comfortable with exploring non-public API functions in the library, you can use the following helper function to ensure that exact duplicate sets are correctly represented in the kNN graph. Please note, this function is not officially supported and is not part of the public API:\n",

    "- Construct the CSR (Compressed Sparse Row) matrix from the distances and indices arrays.\n",
