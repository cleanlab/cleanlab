    "# Data Curation with Train vs Test Splits\n",
    "\n",
    "In typical Machine Learning projects, we split our dataset into training data for fitting models and test data to evaluate model performance. For noisy real-world datasets, detecting/correcting errors in the training data is important to train robust models, but it's less recognized that the test set can also be noisy.\n",
    "For accurate model evaluation, it is vital to find and fix issues in the test data as well. Some evaluation metrics are particularly sensitive to outliers and noisy labels.\n",
    "This tutorial demonstrates a way to use [Cleanlab Open Source (CLOS)](https://github.com/cleanlab/cleanlab) to clean both your training and test data, ensuring **robust** model training and **reliable** performance evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how we recommend handling noisy training and test data with CLOS:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "NEEED TO UPDATE THIS\n",
    "\n",
    "- First focus on detecting issues in the test data. For the best detection, we recommend that you merge your training and test data and then run a Cleanlab Studio Project (which will benefit from more data) -- but only focus on project results for the test data.\n",
    "- Manually review/correct Cleanlab-detected issues in your test data. To avoid bias, we caution against automated correction of test data. Instead, test data changes should be individually verified to ensure they will lead to more accurate model evaluation.\n",
    "- Run a separate Cleanlab Studio project on the training data alone to detect issues in the training data (without any test set information leakage).\n",
    "- Optionally, use automated Cleanlab suggestions to algorithmically refine the training data (or manually review/correct Cleanlab-detected issues in your training data).\n",
    "- Estimate the final model's performance on the cleaned test data. **Do not compare the performance of different ML models estimated across different versions of your test data.** These estimates are incomparable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider this tutorial as a blueprint for using Cleanlab Studio in ML projects spanning various data modalities and tasks.\n",
    "Let’s get started!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: We are using tabular data in this tutorial but the approach can apply to other data modalities!"
