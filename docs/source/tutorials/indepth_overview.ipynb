    "# The Workflows of Data-centric AI for Classification with Noisy Labels\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, you will learn how to easily incorporate [cleanlab](https://github.com/cleanlab/cleanlab) into your ML development workflows to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Automatically find issues such as label errors, outliers and near duplicates lurking in your classification data.\n",
    "- Score the label quality of every example in your dataset.\n",
    "- Train robust models in the presence of label issues.\n",
    "- Identify overlapping classes that you can merge to make the learning task less ambiguous.\n",
    "- Generate an overall label health score to track improvements in your labels as you clean your datasets over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial provides an in-depth survey of many possible different ways that cleanlab can be utilized for Data-Centric AI. If you have a different use-case in mind that is not supported, please [tell us about it](https://github.com/cleanlab/cleanlab/issues)!\n",
    "While this tutorial focuses on standard multi-class (and binary) classification datasets, cleanlab also supports other tasks including: [data labeled by multiple annotators](multiannotator.html), [multi-label classification](../cleanlab/filter.rst#cleanlab.filter.find_label_issues), and [token classification of text](token_classification.html).\n",
