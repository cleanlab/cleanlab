    "# Detecting Outliers with Cleanlab and PyTorch Image Models (timm)\n",
    "\n",
    "This 5-minute tutorial shows how to detect outliers in image data using Cleanlab and PyTorch. We use the **cifar10** dataset where each image belongs to 1 of 10 classes: `[airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, truck]`. You can easily replace the image dataset + neural network used here with any other Pytorch dataset + neural network (e.g. to instead detect outliers in text data). \n",
    "\n",
    "**Overview of what we'll do in this tutorial:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Pre-process [cifar10](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) to create a Pytorch dataset.\n",
    "- Create `train_data` and `test_data` such that `train_data` only contains images of animals and `test_data` contains images from all classes.\n",
    "- Load pretrained `timm` neural network model and extract `train_data` and `test_data` feature embeddings from its representations.\n",
    "- Use `cleanlab` to find naturally occurring outlier examples in the `train_data` (i.e. atypical images).\n",
    "- Find outlier examples in the `test_data` that do not stem from training data distribution (including out-of-distribution non-animal images).\n",
    "- Explore threshold selection for determining which images are outliers vs not."

    "### How does cleanlab detect outliers?\n",
    "\n",
    "Outlier scores are defined relative to the average distance (computed over feature values) between each example and its K nearest neighbors in the training data. Such scores have been found to be particularly effective for out-of-distribution detection, see this paper for more details:\n",
    "\n",
    "[Back to the Basics: Revisiting Out-of-Distribution Detection Baselines](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.03061)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Internally, `cleanlab` uses the `sklearn.neighbors.NearestNeighbor` class (with *cosine* distance) to find the K nearest neighbors, but you can easily use another KNN estimator with `get_outlier_scores()`. Note that this class by default utilizes the *minkowski* distance, but we recommend using *cosine* distance between neural net representations of data.\n",
