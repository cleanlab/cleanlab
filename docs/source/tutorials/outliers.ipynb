    "# Detect Outliers with Cleanlab and PyTorch Image Models (timm)\n",
    "\n",
    "This quickstart tutorial shows how to detect outliers (out-of-distribution examples) in image data, using the [cifar10](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) dataset as an example. You can easily replace the image dataset + neural network used here with any other Pytorch dataset + neural network (e.g. to instead detect outliers in text data with minimal code changes). \n",
    "\n",
    "**Overview of what we'll do in this tutorial:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Detect outliers using `feature_embeddings`\n",
    "\n",
    "- Pre-process [cifar10](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) into Pytorch datasets where `train_data` only contains images of animals and `test_data` contains images from all classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use a pretrained neural network model from [timm](https://github.com/rwightman/pytorch-image-models) to extract feature embeddings of each image.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use cleanlab to find naturally occurring outlier examples in the `train_data` (i.e. atypical images).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Find outlier examples in the `test_data` that do not stem from training data distribution (including out-of-distribution non-animal images).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Explore threshold selection for determining which images are outliers vs not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Detect outliers using `pred_probs` from a trained classifier\n",
    "\n",
    "- Adapt our [timm](https://github.com/rwightman/pytorch-image-models) network into a classifier by training an  additional output layer using the (in-distribution) training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use cleanlab to find out-of-distribution examples in the dataset based on the probabilistic predictions of this classifier, as an alternative to relying on feature embeddings."

Detecting outliers based on predicted probabilities applies mainly for labeled classification datasets, but can be done with any effective classifier.
