This includes data from any modality such as: image, text, tabular, audio, etc. For text data, cleanlab also supports NLP tasks like entity recognition in which each word is individually labeled (token classification).

    "1. Use cleanlab to find label issues in your test data as well (we recommend pooling `labels` across both training and test data into one input for `find_label_issues()`). Then manually review and fix label issues identified in the test data to verify accuracy measurements are actually meaningful.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "3. Try to find a better model (eg. via hyperparameter tuning or changing to another classifier). `CleanLearning` can find better label issues by leveraging a better model, which allows it to produce better quality training data. This can form a virtuous cycle in which better models -> better issue detection -> better data -> even better models! \n",
    "\n",
    "4. Try jointly tuning both model hyperparameters and `find_label_issues_kwargs` values.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Does your dataset have a *junk* (or *clutter*, *unknown*, *other*) class? If you have bad data, consider creating one (c.f. Caltech-256).\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Consider merging similar/overlapping classes found via ``cleanlab.dataset.find_overlapping_classes``.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other general tips to improve label error detection performance:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Try creating more restrictive new filters by combining their intersections (e.g. `combined_boolean_mask = mask1 & mask2` where `mask1` and `mask2` are the boolean masks created by running `find_label_issues` with different values of the `filter_by` argument).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. If your `pred_probs` are obtained via a neural network, try averaging the `pred_probs` over the last K epochs of training instead of just using the final `pred_probs`. Similarly, you can try averaging `pred_probs` from several models (remember to re-normalize) or using ``cleanlab.rank.get_label_quality_ensemble_scores``.\n"
