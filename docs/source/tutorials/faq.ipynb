    "At this time, CleanLearning only works with data formatted as numpy matrices or pd.DataFrames, \n",
    "and with models that are compatible with the `sklearn` API \n",

    "If CleanLearning is running successfully but not improving predictive accuracy of your model, here are some tips:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use cleanlab to find label issues in your test data as well (we recommend pooling `labels` across both training and test data into one input for `find_label_issues()`). Then manually review and fix label issues identified in the test data to verify accuracy measurements are actually meaningful.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Try different values for `filter_by`, frac_noise`, and `min_examples_per_class` which can be set via the `find_label_issues_kwargs` argument in the initialization of `CleanLearning()`. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Try to find a better model (eg. via hyperparameter tuning or changing to another classifier). `CleanLearning` can find better label issues by leveraging a better model, which allows it to produce better quality training data. This can form a virtuous cycle in which better models -> better issue detection -> better data -> even better models! \n",
    "\n",
    "4. Try jointly tuning both model hyperparameters and `find_label_issues_kwargs` values.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Does your dataset have a *junk* (or *clutter*, *unknown*, *other*) class? If you have bad data, consider creating one (c.f. Caltech-256).\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Consider merging similar/overlapping classes found via ``cleanlab.dataset.find_overlapping_classes``.",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Other general tips to improve label error detection performance:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Try combining (e.g. `combined_filter = filter1 & filter2`) any subset of the boolean masks found using `find_label_issues` for more restrictive filtering.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. If your `pred_probs` are obtained via a neural network, try averaging the `pred_probs` over the last K epochs of training instead of just using the final `pred_probs`. Similarly, you can try averaging `pred_probs` from several models (remember to re-normalize) or using ``cleanlab.rank.get_label_quality_ensemble_scores``.\n"
