Try to find a better model (eg. via hyperparameter tuning or changing to another classifier). `CleanLearning` can find better label issues by leveraging a better model, which allows it to produce better quality training data.

    "\n",
    "2. If your `pred_probs` are obtained via a neural network, try averaging the `pred_probs` over the last K epochs of training instead of just using the final `pred_probs`. Similarly, you can try averaging `pred_probs` from several models (remember to re-normalize) or using ``cleanlab.rank.get_label_quality_ensemble_scores``.\n"
