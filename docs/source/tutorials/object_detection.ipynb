    "# Finding Label Errors in Object Detection Datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "This 5-minute quickstart tutorial demonstrates how to find potential label errors in object detection datasets. In object detection data, each image is annotated with multiple bounding boxes. Each bounding box surrounds a physical object within an image scene, and is annotated with a given class label. \n",
    "\n",
    "Using such labeled data, we train a model to predict the locations and classes of objects in an image. An example notebook to train the object detection model whose predictions we rely on in this tutorial is available [here](https://github.com/cleanlab/examples/blob/master/object_detection/detectron2_training.ipynb). These predictions can subsequently be input to cleanlab in order to identify mislabeled images and a quality score quantifying our confidence in the overall annotations for each image.  \n",
    "\n",
    "After correcting these label issues, **you can train an even better version of your model without changing your training code!**\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial uses a subset of the [COCO (Common Objects in Context)](https://cocodataset.org/#home) dataset which has images of everyday scenes and considers objects from the 5 most popular classes: car, chair, cup, person, traffic light.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "- Score images based on their overall label quality (i.e. our confidence each image is correctly labeled) using `cleanlab.object_detection.rank.get_label_quality_scores`\n",
    "- Estimate which images have label issues using `cleanlab.object_detection.filter.find_label_issues`\n",
    "- Visually review images + labels using `cleanlab.object_detection.summary.visualize`\n",
