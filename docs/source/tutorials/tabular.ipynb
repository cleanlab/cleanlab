This dataset contains 1,000 individuals described by 20 features, each labeled as either \"good\" or \"bad\" credit risk. cleanlab automatically shortlists _hundreds_ of examples from this dataset that confuse our ML model; many of which are potential label errors (due to annotator mistakes), edge cases, and otherwise ambiguous examples.\n",
